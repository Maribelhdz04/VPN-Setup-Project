# How It Works

This project sets up an IPsec VPN using StrongSwan. The VPN server is configured to handle client authentication and data encryption through the IPsec protocol.

## VPN Server
The server runs StrongSwan, which is configured with IPsec for secure communication. It authenticates clients using pre-shared keys or certificates, establishes a secure tunnel, and routes data to and from clients.

## VPN Clients
The clients connect to the VPN server by initiating a secure connection. After authentication, the communication between the client and server is encrypted through the IPsec tunnel.

## IPsec Protocol
IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) provides confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity by encrypting and authenticating IP packets. It uses protocols like IKE (Internet Key Exchange) for key exchange and ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) for encryption.

## Communication Flow
1. The client connects to the server.
2. The server authenticates the client and establishes the tunnel using IKE.
3. Encrypted data flows securely through the VPN tunnel.
